	abstract = {Bangkok clay (BC) is notorious for its poor engineering properties in Thailand and world-widely. In terms of workability, it is significant to modify its naturally weak properties. Nowadays, humans are overusing Earth’s resources and generating so much waste. In consequence, eco-friendly and cost cutting improvements are appreciated in geotechnical field. At the same time, Rice Husk Ash (RHA) is a cheap potential material for soil improvement. Lime is also known as a common material used in soil stabilization both solely and mixed with other materials. An inevitable step to every soil stabilization is to perform compaction tests that gives basic notions to treat soil. In this experimental study, compaction tests were proceeded with soil mixed with 0%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 50% of Rice Husk Ash (RHA) by dry soil mass in replacement manner and added 0%, 4%, 8%, 12% of lime. Overall, the more RHA and lime amount is mixed with soil, the higher Optimum Moisture Content (OMC) gets. This means that when replacement/stabilizers are added more and more, the soil needs more water to reach its Maximum Dry Density (MDD). Unlike OMC, MDD reduces when quantity of additives is increased.}

	ABSTRACT = {Soft soils are commonly located in many regions near seas, oceans, and rivers all over the world. These regions are vital and attractive for population and governments development. Soft soil is classified as problematic soil owing to sustaining low shear strength and high settlement under structures. Constructing structures and/or infrastructures on soft soil is a considerable risk that needs great attention from structural engineers. The bearing capacity of structure foundations on soft soil depends mainly on their undrained shear strength. This soil feature strongly influences the selection of appropriate soil improvement methods. However, determining undrained shear strength is very difficult, costly, and time-consuming, especially for sensitive clay. Consequently, extracting undisturbed samples of sensitive clay faces several difficulties on construction sites. In this research, accurate field-tested data were fed to advanced machine learning models to predict the undrained shear strength of the sensitive clay to save hard effort, time, repeated laboratory testing, and costs. In this context, a dataset of 111 geotechnical testing points were collected based on laboratory and field examinations of the soil’s key features. These features included the water content, liquid limit, dry unit weight, plasticity index, consistency index, void ratio, specific gravity, and pocket penetration shear. Several machine learning algorithms were adopted to provide the soft clay modeling, including the linear, Gaussian process regression, ensemble and regression trees, and the support vector regression. The coefficient of determination was mainly used to assess the performance of each predictive model. The achieved results revealed that the support vector regression model attained the most accurate prediction for soil undrained shear strength. These outcomes lay the groundwork for evaluating soil shear strength characteristics in a practical, fast, and low-cost way.},

	abstract = { Undrained shear strength serves as one of the crucial indicators for analyzing the strength and assessing the stability of clay. To enhance the predictive capability of undrained shear strength, we introduced a hybrid stacking model, the KSMRX, which leverages the Bayesian optimization algorithm. Comparative analyses against base models revealed that the KSMRX model significantly enhanced prediction accuracy, elevating it from 51.3\% to 72.5\%. This substantial improvement underscored the efficacy of our approach in predicting drained shear strength. Moreover, when compared with the prediction accuracies of 15 other hybrid models, the KSMRX hybrid stacking model consistently demonstrated superior performance. Therefore, this study not only presents a novel and more convenient computational approach, facilitating the acquisition of highly accurate geotechnical parameters, but also serves as a reference for the implementation of geotechnical engineering projects. }

	ABSTRACT = {Determination of shear strength of soil is very important in civil engineering for foundation design, earth and rock fill dam design, highway and airfield design, stability of slopes and cuts, and in the design of coastal structures. In this study, a novel hybrid soft computing model (RF-PSO) of random forest (RF) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) was developed and used to estimate the undrained shear strength of soil based on the clay content (%), moisture content (%), specific gravity (%), void ratio (%), liquid limit (%), and plastic limit (%). In this study, the experimental results of 127 soil samples from national highway project Hai Phong-Thai Binh of Vietnam were used to generate datasets for training and validating models. Pearson correlation coefficient (R) method was used to evaluate and compare performance of the proposed model with single RF model. The results show that the proposed hybrid model (RF-PSO) achieved a high accuracy performance (R = 0.89) in the prediction of shear strength of soil. Validation of the models also indicated that RF-PSO model (R = 0.89 and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) = 0.453) is superior to the single RF model without optimization (R = 0.87 and RMSE = 0.48). Thus, the proposed hybrid model (RF-PSO) can be used for accurate estimation of shear strength which can be used for the suitable designing of civil engineering structures.},

	ABSTRACT = {The undrained shear strength of clay is an important index for the calculation of the bearing capacity of the foundation soil, the calculation of the soil pressure of the foundation pit, and the analysis of the slope stability. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to conduct a comprehensive study of the combined use of machine learning with clay theoretical equations to estimate it. Under the Bayesian framework, the CatBoost algorithm (CatBoost–Bayesian) based on Bayesian optimization algorithm was developed to obtain the feature importance level of soil parameters affecting the undrained shear strength of clay, so as to adaptively couple the theoretical equation of undrained shear strength of K0 consolidated clay, which was derived from the modified Cambridge model. Then, the theoretical equation of undrained shear strength of the isotropically consolidated clay was established from the critical state of the clay parameters. Finally, it was illustrated and verified using the experimental samples of Finnish clay. The results indicate that the theoretical equation established by the overconsolidation ratio and effective overburden pressure parameters can well estimate the undrained shear strength of isotropically consolidated clays, and the parameter uncertainty can be considered explicitly and rigorously.},

	volume={17}, url={https://geomatejournal.com/geomate/article/view/274}, 
	abstractNote={&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;All the important infrastructures in Bangkok city are founded in soft, stiff to hard clay layers up to 80 m deep. The engineering properties of these clays depend a lot on their microstructure, which in turns is a result of geological conditions governing the deposition and subsequent geological processes of loading, unloading and weathering. Thus, a study of soil microstructure would help understand better the soil engineering properties to be used in geotechnical analyses. In this paper, a detailed review of sea level-related engineering geology of the depositional environment of Bangkok clays was made. Geotechnical boreholes were drilled at six testing sites as part of a groundwater recovery study project, from which samples of Bangkok clays were collected up to 80 m deep and tested. Based on the results of an integrated geological-geotechnical analysis the microstructure of Bangkok clays was indirectly investigated via their intrinsic compression behavior and in-situ state. &amp;amp;nbsp;It was found that the Soft Bangkok clay at depth 4-11m (SOCL) is a bonding-dominated or cemented clay with a meta-stable structure, whereas stiff clay at depth 12-24m (STCL), the first hard clay at depth 30-50 m (HCL01) and the second hard clay at 50-80 m (HCL02) are fabric dominated with a stable structure. On the plots of void index versus depth the in-situ state the Bangkok soft clay lie in the sedimentation compression range, the stiff clay and the first hard clay lie both in sedimentation compression and overconsolidated clay ranges, while the second deeper hard clay (HCL02) lies only in the overconsolidated clay range. &amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;},

	The mineralogy and chemistry of two marine alluvial deposits with different parent materials, Ariake clay with pyroclastic origin and Bangkok clay with non-pyroclastic origin, were compared and their correlation with geotechnical index properties was discussed. The predominant clay mineral in both clay deposits was smectite, but the smectite in Bangkok clay was found to be of the high-swelling type while that in Ariake clay is of the low-swelling type from the sediment volume determination. The range of the liquid limit and activity was mostly 100 to 140% and 1.25 to 1.90 for Bangkok clay, and 60 to 140% and 0.75 to 1.25 for Ariake clay. A positive correlation existed between the activity and the smectite content for each of Bangkok and Ariake clays, where the greater increasing ratio of the activity for Bangkok clay was attributed to the high-swelling nature of the smectite. The liquid limit of an Na-saturated sample for Bangkok clay increased with increasing NaCl concentration and when substituting Ca for Na in a similar manner to Ariake clay, but the extent of the liquid limit change by such treatments was much smaller for Bangkok clay than for Ariake clay.}

	abstract = { The purposes of in situ testing are set out, and the difficulties of the interpretation of the observations are emphasized. These difficulties are due to the complex behaviour of soils together with the lack of control and of choice of the boundary conditions in any field test. One notable exception is the pressuremeter test, from which soil properties can be derived directly without recourse to empirical correlations. The discussion is concentrated on the measurement of undrained shear strength. The results obtained from different tests (triaxial, plane strain, direct simple shear, pressuremeter and vane) are compared by expressing them in terms of the undrained strength ratio su/σv0′ as a function of the friction angle φ. Special attention is paid to tests in which the principal axes of stress and of strain increment are free to rotate. In such tests, uncertainty exists regarding the definition of failure and the planes of maximum stress obliquity. To derive these functions Matsuoka's failure criterion is used. As a consequence a theoretical hierarchy of strengths is established which agrees qualitatively with experimental evidence. The importance to a designer of this variety of strengths is emphasized. A study is made of the piezocone and the interpretation of the pore pressures in terms of the overconsolidation ratio of the clay tested. A plea is made for the standardization of the equipment, the operation and the interpretation of in situ tests to obtain maximum benefit from them. L'article décrit les buts des essais in situ et souligne les difficultés de l'interprétation des mesures. Ces difficultés sont dues au comportement complexe des sols, combiné avec le manque de contrôle et de choix des conditions limites qu'on a dans n'importe quel essai in situ. Une exception importante est l'essai pressiométrique—à partir duquel on peut evaluer directement des propriétés du sol sans être obligé de recourir à des correlations empiriques. La discussion se concentre sur la mesure de la résistance au cisaillement non-drainé. On compare les résultats obtenus à partir des différents essais (triaxial, déformation plane, cisaillement simple direct, pressiomètre et scissomètre) en les exprimant en fonction du rapport su/σv0′ de la résistance dans l'état non-drainé et en fonction de l'angle de friction φ. On étudie plus particulièrement les essais dans lesquels les axes principaux de l'augmentation de la contrainte et de la déformation peuvent tourner librement. Dans de tels cas il existe une incertitude concernant la définition de la rupture et des plans de l'obliquité maximale des contraintes. Afin de trouver ces fonctions on emploie le critère de rupture de Matsuoka. On établit par conséquent une hiérarchic théorique des résistances qui s'accorde qualitativement avec les résultats expérimentaux. On souligne l'importance pour le projeteur de ces diverses résistances. On étudie aussi le piézocône et l'interprétation des pressions interstitielles en fonction du rapport de surconsolidation de l'argile testée. On recommande que l'appareillage, l'exécution et l'interprétation des essais sur place soient uniformisés afin d'en tirer l'avantage maximal. }

	abstract = {The standard penetration test (SPT) is one of the most widely used in situ penetration tests for subsurface exploration. Its suitability for assessing and predicting the design parameters of granular materials has been well appreciated by the geotechnical engineering community over several decades. However, in the case of soft to very soft clays, the correlation between the standard penetration number (N) and the undrained shear strength is poor. In the recent past, tests conducted at a constant rate of penetration, such as the cone penetration test (CPT), ball penetration test, and T-bar penetration test, have become popular in soft clay regions. These tests also have a distinct advantage over SPT in terms of test setup because, in the case of SPT, the entire weight of the sampler and the rod assembly is directly applied on the subsoil, whereas in the case of CPT, the weight of the assembly is supported externally prior to the penetration. This can cause significant operational advantage in case of soft clay deposits. Despite the shortcomings, SPT is still one of the most widely available site investigation tools in the field, as samples are available for inspection and index tests. The operational disadvantages in the case of soft clay deposits can be overcome by altering the penetration process of SPT. A quasi-static penetration at a constant rate rather than a dynamic penetration will help establish a relationship between the penetration resistance and the strength parameters of soft soils. In this article, a quasi-static penetration test using the standard SPT sampler is conducted on reconstituted clay samples in order to develop an empirical correlation with the laboratory vane shear strength. The particle image velocimetry technique is used for detecting the influence zone and plugging during penetration.},

	ABSTRACT = {This study presents a novel method for predicting the undrained shear strength (cu) using artificial intelligence technology. The cu value is critical in geotechnical applications and difficult to directly determine without laboratory tests. The group method of data handling (GMDH)-type neural network (NN) was utilized for the prediction of cu. The GMDH-type NN models were designed with various combinations of input parameters. In the prediction, the effective stress (σv’), standard penetration test result (NSPT), liquid limit (LL), plastic limit (PL), and plasticity index (PI) were used as input parameters in the design of the prediction models. In addition, the GMDH-type NN models were compared with the most commonly used method (i.e., linear regression) and other regression models such as random forest (RF) and support vector regression (SVR) models as comparative methods. In order to evaluate each model, the correlation coefficient (R2), mean absolute error (MAE), and root mean square error (RMSE) were calculated for different input parameter combinations. The most effective model, the GMDH-type NN with input parameters (e.g., σv’, NSPT, LL, PL, PI), had a higher correlation coefficient (R2 = 0.83) and lower error rates (MAE = 14.64 and RMSE = 22.74) than other methods used in the prediction of cu value. Furthermore, the impact of input variables on the model output was investigated using the SHAP (SHApley Additive ExPlanations) technique based on the extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) ensemble learning algorithm. The results demonstrated that using the GMDH-type NN is an efficient method in obtaining a new empirical mathematical model to provide a reliable prediction of the undrained shear strength of soils.},

For this purpose, case studies of 188 plastic clay soil samples collected from two major projects, Nhat Tan and Cua Dai bridges in Viet Nam have been used for generating training and testing datasets for constructing and validating the models. Validation and comparison of the models have been carried out using RMSE, and R. The results show that the PANFIS has the highest prediction capability (RMSE = 0.038 and R = 0.601), followed by the GANFIS (RMSE = 0.04 and R = 0.569), SVR (RMSE = 0.044 and R = 0.549), and ANN (RMSE = 0.059 and R = 0.49).
